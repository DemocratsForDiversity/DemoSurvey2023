<h2>Full Results Charts</h2>

<img src="age.png">
<p>A bit over half of DfDers are between 22-30.</p>

<img src="ethnicity.png">
<p>White.</p>

<img src="sexgenderbar.png">
<p>DfD is mostly white, msotly men, mostly cis, but only about half het!</p>

<img src="education.png">

<img src="professions.png">
<p>Tech workers just barely beat out reddit shitposters to be the biggest industry of DfD.</p>

<img src="locations2.png">
<p>We seemed to have lost most non-American users ðŸ˜”. Except the Canadians, who now almost outnumber the rest of the world.</p>

<img src="religionspirituality.png">
<p>Displayed percentages are a bit off due to this being a multi-choice question again and software limitations. In actuality, 48% of respondents chose atheist, 26.1% agnostic, 17.4% Christian, 13.0% Judaism, and 6.5% Islam.</p>

<img src="basicdemo.png">
<p>The smallest groups had to be consolidated to avoid being personally identifying. Sorry, person who is dating her/their/its/his ass.</p>

<img src="gendersexuality.png">
<p>I spent two work days making this unreadable mess of a chart lol</p>

<img src="ideologies2.png">
<p>Most of DfD identifies as some flavor of libs and regard themselves as occupying about the center of the sub's political spectrum.</p>

<img src="ideologies3.png">
<p>I say political labels are dumb, but it does appear there's a noticeable difference how different groups regard themselves relative to the other users.</p>

<img src="ideologies4.png">
<p>DfD follows general population trends with women, younger, gender minorities users being noticeably more to the left.</p>

<img src="politicalcompass2.png">
<p>Why is the Lib-Right or Auth-Left quadrants always (relatively) empty on every political compass?</p>

<img src="relationships.png">
<p>Furries were included on this chart for space reasons.</p>

<img src="kinkiness.png">
<p>The most woman on top demo on DfD is the Polyfidel Furries-in-Denial caucus.</p>

<img src="elections20162020.png">
<p>Marked shift from earlier years showing a majority of Hillary supporters in 2016. Not sure how much of this is retconning vs user base changing though.</p>

<img src="elections2024.png">
<p>Shout out to the one (1) single DfDer who has no idea Trump is the 2024 Republican nominee. Or the great prophet of DfD who alone forsaw Trump's defeat.</p>

<img src="platforms.png">
<p>IRC surprisingly going strong(er than Mastodon).</p>

<img src="barbie.png">
<p></p>

<img src="comments.png">
<p>That last person lies ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”.</p>

<img src="ideologiesankey.png">
<p>Yeah I don't know why I thought this was a good idea either.</p>
